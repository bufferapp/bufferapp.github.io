# Buffer Driven Development

  In August 2014 the development team at Buffer has grown to 10 people.  A year prior we were a small team of 3 people.

  Growing our team this past year has been both exciting and scary. It has often felt like two steps forward one step back.

  Inspired by our overall [Buffer values](http://www.slideshare.net/Bufferapp/buffer-culture-04), seeking to define in words the development culture we've built, I asked everyone on our team to describe what Buffer's development culture is today, and how they envision it evolving.

  This is how we would describe the culture of being a developer at Buffer today.
  
  As with everything else at Buffer this is a work-in-progress and this isn't set in stone.
